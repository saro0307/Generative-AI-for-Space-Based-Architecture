# Generative AI for Space-Based Architecture

## Project Overview

This project leverages generative AI and physics-based simulations to design sustainable habitats for extraterrestrial environments. Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) conditioned on planetary data, the project aims to generate habitat designs optimized for environmental factors such as temperature, gravity, and radiation. 

This tool could be used to explore potential habitat designs for different planets, simulate environmental viability, and visualize structural blueprints.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and preparation of planetary data for model input.
- **Generative Habitat Design**: A GAN model that generates habitat features based on environmental constraints.
- **Environmental Suitability Check**: Physics-based checks for temperature, gravity, and radiation.
- **Blueprint Visualization**: Visual representation of generated habitat designs.
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based web app for user interaction, enabling easy input of planetary parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip for package management
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saro0307/space-habitat-ai.git
    cd space-habitat-ai
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. **Prepare Data**: Add planetary and environmental data to `data/planetary_data.csv`.

2. **Train the GAN Model**:
    ```bash
    python models/gan_training.py
    ```
   Adjust parameters in `gan_training.py` if needed.

3. **Run Simulations**: Verify environmental suitability with `simulation/environmental_check.py`.

4. **Launch the Web App**:
    ```bash
    python web_app/app.py
    ```
   Access the app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

5. **Blueprint Visualization**: Use `utils/visualization.py` to visualize habitat blueprints.

## Example

To generate a habitat design for Mars with specific environmental parameters:

1. Run the web app and enter Mars parameters.
2. The AI model will generate a design based on input parameters.
3. Results and suggestions based on environmental suitability will be displayed.
